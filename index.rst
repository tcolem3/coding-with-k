Welcome to Coding With Kids's documentation!
============================================
Coding with kids can be a *great* 
way to not only teach them some skills 
that will help them with their 
own lives, but also *create or 
strengthen* some lasting 
**bonds between you and them.**

Throughout your journey you will 
both likely learn new ``concepts`` and 
``terms`` that will expand your horizons and 
provide hours of enjoyment.

There are lots of great options for 
where to start,  
and :doc:`/Options/justlogic` is a great 
place to start. Note that 
the :doc:`best starting point </Options/justlogic>` is 
another way to refer to the same place 
but give your link text some title.

For details about the hardware and code options,
see :ref:`Options section for hardware and code <hwcodeOptions>` .
